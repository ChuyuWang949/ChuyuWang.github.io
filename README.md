Actually, I have been thinking for a long time about what to write, and suddenly I feel like writing some seemingly meaningless material. But this is my 'world'! I can write whatever I want! The main content will include, but is not limited to: research paper notes, exam preparation notes, as well as some thoughts on life, feelings about cooking, listening to music, watching movies, and learning musical instruments.
